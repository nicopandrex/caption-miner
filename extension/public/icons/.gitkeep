# Placeholder Icons

To generate actual icons, use an online tool like:

- https://favicon.io/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or create in Photoshop/GIMP

Recommended icon design:

- A book with Chinese characters
- A microphone or caption symbol
- Blue/purple color scheme

For now, you can use any square images renamed to:

- icon16.png
- icon48.png
- icon128.png
